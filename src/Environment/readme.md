### Environment
----

Miss the old environment configuration in Laravel 4? where you can specify specific provider for each env, well this is your answer.


#### Installation
----

Just register this environment service provider in your `config/app.php` and run the `php artisan vendor:publish`.

A new configuration file will be created in your `config` directory, and you'll know what to do from there.
